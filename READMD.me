# 🎬 Netflix-Style Recommendation Engine

## 📌 Project Overview
I built a movie recommendation engine (like Netflix) using Python. It uses **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** to find patterns in user ratings and suggest movies that are mathematically similar.

## 📊 Visuals & Results
### 1. User Clusters (Heatmap)
This heatmap shows how different users rated movies. You can clearly see clusters of "Action Fans" vs. "Animation Fans."

### 2. The Recommendation Engine
I tested the system by asking for movies similar to **"The Dark Knight"**. The system correctly recommended **"Inception"** (another Christopher Nolan movie) as the top match.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Data:** Generated 500 dummy users with specific preferences.
2. **Matrix:** Built a User-Item pivot table.
3. **Math:** Used Pearson Correlation to calculate the "distance" between movies.

## 📂 Project Structure
* **Scripts:** The Python code (`.ipynb` file).
* **Outputs:** The screenshots and charts.
